# Neural-Graph-Generation-with-conditioning
In this project, I participated alongside two teammates as part of the M2 - ALTEGRAD course (2024-25 Data Challenge) under the DaSciM group at LIX, Ã‰cole Polytechnique. The challenge, hosted on Kaggle, focused on applying machine learning and AI techniques to generate graphs with specific properties based on text descriptions.  


# Challenge Overview:  

The goal of the project was to generate realistic graphs with specific properties, using machine learning models like Auto-Regressive models, Variational Autoencoders, GANs, Normalizing Flows, and Diffusion models. The task involved generating graphs based on text queries describing desired graph structures, with the solution achieved through training a latent diffusion model for conditional graph generation.
